# text-editor-app

## Description
This is a text editor that runs in the browser. The app will be a single-page application that meets the PWA criteria. Additionally, it will feature a number of data persistence techniques that serve as redundancy in case one of the options is not supported by the browser. The application will also function offline.

## User Story
AS A developer <br>
I WANT to create notes or code snippets with or without an internet connection<br>
SO THAT I can reliably retrieve them for later use
